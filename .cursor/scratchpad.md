# Carlos Wine Assistant - Error Analysis

## Background and Motivation
The user is experiencing a `NameError: name 'sqlite3' is not defined` error when running the Carlos Wine Assistant application. The application is designed to use Supabase for database operations, but there are still references to SQLite in the code.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Mixed Database Systems**: The application has been migrated to use Supabase but still contains SQLite code in `app.py`
2. **Import Issues**: The `sqlite3` module is not imported in the files where it's being used
3. **Inconsistent Database Access**: Some parts of the code use Supabase services while others try to access SQLite directly

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Identify all SQLite references** - Find all places where SQLite is being used instead of Supabase
2. **Remove SQLite dependencies** - Replace SQLite code with Supabase service calls
3. **Test the application** - Ensure the application works correctly with Supabase only
4. **Update requirements** - Remove any SQLite-related dependencies if not needed elsewhere

## Project Status Board
- [ ] **Task 1**: Identify and document all SQLite references in the codebase
- [ ] **Task 2**: Replace SQLite code with Supabase service calls
- [ ] **Task 3**: Test the application to ensure it works correctly
- [ ] **Task 4**: Clean up any unused imports or dependencies

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Error Fixed
**Issue Resolved**: `NameError: name 'sqlite3' is not defined` in app.py

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Identified all SQLite references in app.py (2 locations)
2. ✅ Replaced SQLite database calls with Supabase service calls
3. ✅ Installed missing supabase dependency
4. ✅ Tested application - imports successfully without sqlite3 errors

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
**RESOLVED**: The main error has been fixed. The application now imports successfully and no longer has the `NameError: name 'sqlite3' is not defined` issue.

**Remaining Notes**: The Supabase connection will fail without proper credentials, but that's expected and separate from the original SQLite import error.

## Lessons
- Always check for mixed database systems when migrating from one database to another
- Ensure all database operations use the same service layer
- When fixing import errors, verify all dependencies are installed
- SQLite references in code need to be completely replaced when migrating to Supabase
