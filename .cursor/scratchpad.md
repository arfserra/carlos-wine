# Carlos Wine Assistant - Edit Wine Feature Enhancement

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to add an "Edit Wine" feature to the main menu that allows users to:
1. Change wine position (choose from a dropdown with other available positions)
2. Delete wine from the collection

This feature should be easily accessible from the main menu and provide a user-friendly interface for wine management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **UI Integration**: Need to add a new button to the main menu/sidebar
2. **Wine Selection**: Need to provide a way for users to select which wine to edit
3. **Position Management**: Need to show available positions in a dropdown format
4. **Delete Functionality**: Need to implement wine deletion (currently only has "mark as consumed")
5. **Database Operations**: Need to add delete wine method to the database service

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Add Edit Wine Button** - Add a new button to the sidebar for editing wines
2. **Create Wine Selection Interface** - Allow users to select which wine to edit
3. **Implement Edit Wine Dialog** - Create interface with options to change position or delete
4. **Add Delete Wine Method** - Implement wine deletion in database service
5. **Test Edit Wine Feature** - Ensure all functionality works correctly

## Project Status Board
- [x] **Task 1**: Add "Edit Wine" button to the sidebar in app.py

## Lessons
- Always check for mixed database systems when migrating from one database to another
- Ensure all database operations use the same service layer
- When fixing import errors, verify all dependencies are installed
- SQLite references in code need to be completely replaced when migrating to Supabase
- When adding new features, analyze existing patterns and maintain consistency with current UI/UX
